      <p> Hello! My name is Elizabeth and I am Junior at Cristo Rey Jesuit High School. This summer I have decided to participate in Girls Who Code. During the program I have learned to use my talent of art into coding.

    At Girls Who Code I have been able to learn more about coding. This program has not only helped me with expanding my knowledge but creating a sisterhood like no other.
